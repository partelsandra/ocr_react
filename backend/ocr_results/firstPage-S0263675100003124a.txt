Short titles ot Old English texts
addenda and cottigenda

BRUCE MITCHELL, CHRISTOPHER BALL
and ANGUS CAMERON

The compilers of the list of Short Titles of Old English Texts, ASE 
(1975), 20721, have received some valuable criticisms and suggestions for
its improvement and have now had four yeats experience of using the list.
As  result some additions and corrections are necessary. We are grateful to
the editors of Anglo-Saxon England, and in particular to Professor Peter
Clemoes, for the opportunity of presenting them here.

 few general points must be made before the alterations proposed for
specific short titles are discussed. No criticisms of the principles on which the
list was based have been received and the compilers have found no reason for
altering them.  specific merit of the system is its flexibility. It provides for
the supplementation ofa short title by the addition of (an obvious abbrevia-
tion for) the name of an editor of the text andor of  detailed reference to an
edition (see ASE , 208-). Users of the short titles will find that they can
sometimes save their reader the trouble of referring to Camerons List of
Old English Texts by using one or both of these devices. These have been
strikingly exploited by . Wenisch (Anglia 96 (1978), -18) some of his
suggestions have been incorporated in our list. If desired,  short title can
similarly be supplemented by adding the name of the text, .. ZELS 32
(Edmund), LS  (Chad) and LS 10 (Guthlac). This meets, in part at least, an
objection made by . . Hoad (RES 28 (1977), 194)-

The compilers stated, When there is  conflict between the Cameron
number of an item and that in the specified edition, the former will prevail
(ASE , 208). To this sentence should be added the words except where
otherwise specified, namely in ZEHom, ZELS, VercFHom and WHom. ZECHom
will be referred to by volume number, page and line in Thorpes edition
until the editions by . . . Clemoes (ECHom ) and . . Godden
(ECHom 11) have been published.

In issuing this revision the compilers wish to draw special attention to
ASE , 209, .  It is desirable that future editors give marginal references
to the edition which they (hope to) supersede  and would now replace
desirable by essential.
